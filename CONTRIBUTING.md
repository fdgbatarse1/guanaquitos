# Contributing to Guanaquitos

Welcome!

This document is fairly extensive and you aren't really expected
to study this in detail for small contributions;

    The most important rule is that contributing must be easy
    and that the community is friendly and not nitpicking on details

If you're reporting a bug you should read the Reporting bugs section
below to ensure that your bug report contains enough information
to successfully diagnose the issue, and if you're contributing code
you should try to mimic the conventions you see surrounding the code
you're working on, but in the end all patches will be cleaned up by
the person merging the changes so don't worry too much.
